# Basic idea

A daily timetable split into hours (10-12 hrs), 5 days a week. when user click on the each block, they can write the name for that block (potentially add the color picking property) and which appears as a course for university.

### Production

- Timetable functionality
- Able to print out as some sort of file format such as markdown or html
